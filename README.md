# Just a Cats Life (Renpy Example Project)
This is a Python based project I worked on with an artist friend. They provided all the art and dialogue, while I provided the code. We worked together on the story and gameplay direction.
This was coded in a casual time-frame over the course of about a week while working with said friend on the visuals the code produces.

## See the Code
The project code can be seen in './Just-a-Cats-Life'.
A lot of this is effectively just Ren'Py boilerplate; if you're not sure what to look for, the especially interesting stuff can be seen in 'renpy-example-project\Just-a-Cats-Life\scripts'. I believe those files can be opened in most editors, but I know for certain they can be opened in VSCode.

## Run the Game
Simply go to 'renpy-example-project\JustACatsLife-1.0-dists', extract the version that's right for your OS, and run the file correct for your OS. If you'd rather not run the exe yourself but are interesting in seeing it run, feel welcome to reach out to me and I'll be happy to show it to you!
